# ESP32 2WD Robot Car

This repository documents my work for the "CT7159: Sensors, Actuators and Control" module at London Metropolitan University. The project spans three major workshops over three months, involving the construction and programming of a 2WD robot car from the ground up.

The project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of embedded systems, from basic hardware assembly and actuator control to advanced sensor integration, data filtering, and PID control loops.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features & Concepts Explored

This project is divided into three main workshops, each building upon the last:

#### **Workshop 3: Actuators**
* **Hardware Assembly:** Construction of the 2WD chassis with custom 3D-printed mounts for the ESP32 and motor driver.
* **Motor Control:** Driving DC motors using an L9110 H-Bridge driver.
* **Speed Control:** Implementing Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for variable motor speed.
* **Servo Implementation:** Controlling a servo motor for precise angular positioning and sweeping motions.
* **Obstacle Avoidance:** Integrating an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement and implementing an autonomous obstacle avoidance routine.

#### **Workshop 4: Sensors**
* **Custom Libraries:** Designing and implementing a custom C++ library in the Arduino IDE.
* **Analog & Digital Filtering:** Applying Moving Average and Cumulative Average filters to noisy sensor data (MPU-6050 and BMP280).
* **Environmental Sensing:** Interfacing with a BMP280 sensor to read temperature and pressure.
* **Motion Sensing:** Integrating an MPU-6050 accelerometer/gyroscope to measure pitch and roll.
* **Kinetic Control:** Manipulating the robot's motor speed based on the tilt angle detected by the MPU-6050.

#### **Workshop 5: PID Control**
* **Analog Circuits:** Building a physical RC filter circuit to demonstrate control theory concepts.
* **PID Implementation:** Programming and tuning a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to stabilize the output of the RC circuit.
* **Self-Balancing Logic:** Applying the PID controller to the robot car, using the MPU-6050's angle data as feedback to maintain balance.
